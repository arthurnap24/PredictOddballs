1) Changed straight enemy sprite.

2) Doubled health gained from catching a star.

3) Decreased damage from enemy hits.

4) If the player has suffered damage within the last 15 seconds AND there is at least one enemy on screen, then another enemy will not spawn.

5) Multi-enemy screens will happen when the player is doing well.

6) Ammo boxes are more common.

7) Follow enemies move a bit faster and a bit smarter, but stop chasing when past you - this should make analysis simpler.

8) Player gets points for avoiding enemies (in past, player only got points for missile hits).

9) Added more randomness to enemy speed.

10) Smartened enemies so they do not have so many friendly crashes, but this still needs more work.
